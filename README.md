# cave rodent
A cloning attempt of the old win 3.1 game "Rodent's Revenge" written in C using SDL libs.  
Still on alpha version. Moving blocks and the cats AI are working.  
Should compile for Windows and macOS with some minor changes  
To compile on linux: 
- gcc -o cave_rodent cave_rodent.c -lSDL2
